  A callback to be used with `Driver::setCallback()` to define reaction

  Example usage:

    // Use lambda

    driver->setCallback(WebAuthn_Callback{[](SQLString msg){
      cerr << "User action request: " << msg << endl;
    }});

    // Disable default behavior (and do nothing upon action request)

    // Return to default behavior
